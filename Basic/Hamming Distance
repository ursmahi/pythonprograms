The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.


CODE:
x=int(input())
y=int(input())
x=f"{x:b}"
y=f"{y:b}"
c=0
p=len(x)
q=len(y)
if(p>q):
    d=p-q
    y='0'*d+str(y)
else:
    d=q-p;
    x='0'*d+str(x)
for i in range(len(x)):
    if(x[i]!=y[i]):
        c=c+1
print(c)
